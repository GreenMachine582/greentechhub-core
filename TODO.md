# ✅ TODO / Milestones

> Open work only: remove an item when it ships — its release note lands in CHANGELOG.md automatically (release-please). See [README.md](README.md) for context and [docs/](docs/) for the detailed design behind each item.
>
> Shipped work is recorded in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and on the [Releases page](https://github.com/GreenMachine582/greentechhub-core/releases) — this file only tracks what's still open.

## 🗺️ Milestones

### v0.5.1 — AuthentikIdentityProvider OIDC token path
- [ ] Validate `raw.headers["X-authentik-jwt"]` (when configured) against the issuer's JWKS

### v0.6 — Background, observability
- [ ] `observability` — the full OTel `TracerProvider`/`MeterProvider`/exporter setup, once there's a collector to send to ([docs/modules.md](docs/modules.md#observability)). `observability.resource`'s `get_resource_attributes` (`service.name`/`service.version`, no OTel import) has shipped ahead of the rest — the Loki/Alloy JSON logging pipeline wants the same fields today (`logging.setup.configure_logging`'s new `service`/`version` parameters), independent of OTel existing at all.

### v1.0 — Validated in production
- [ ] Both adapter packages consuming this package
- [ ] At least one FastAPI service consuming it in production
- [ ] GreenTechHub (Django) consuming it in production
- [ ] Contract-test suite ([docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md)) has caught at least one real drift

### Post-v1.0
- [ ] `gth` CLI ([docs/modules.md](docs/modules.md#cli-not-v1-worth-leaving-room-for))
